          "Machine learning (ML) is the subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems that learn, or improve performance, based on the data they consume, that is, it teaches computers to learn from experience. Machine learning and AI are often discussed together, and the terms are sometimes used interchangeably, but they don’t mean the same thing. An important distinction is that although all machine learning is AI, not all AI is machine learning. These days, machine learning is at work all around us. When we interact with banks, shop online, or use social media, machine learning algorithms come into play to make our experience efficient, smooth, and secure. Machine learning uses two types of techniques: Supervised learning trains a model on known input and output data so that it can predict future outputs, Supervised machine learning algorithms are the most commonly used. With this model, a data scientist acts as a guide and teaches the algorithm what conclusions it should make. Just as a child learns to identify fruits by memorizing them in a picture book, in supervised learning, the algorithm is trained by a dataset that is already labeled and has a predefined output. Examples of supervised machine learning include algorithms such as linear and logistic regression, multiclass classification, and support vector machines. Unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in input data.Unsupervised machine learning uses a more independent approach, in which a computer learns to identify complex processes and patterns without a human providing close, constant guidance. Unsupervised machine learning involves training based on data that does not have labels or a specific, defined output. To continue the childhood teaching analogy, unsupervised machine learning is akin to a child learning to identify fruit by observing colors and patterns, rather than memorizing the names with a teacher’s help. The child would look for similarities between images and separate them into groups, assigning each group its own new label. Examples of unsupervised machine learning algorithms include k-means clustering, principal and independent component analysis, and association rules. Machine learning has blossomed across a wide range of industries, supporting a variety of business goals and use cases including: • Customer lifetime value • Anomaly detection • Dynamic pricing • Predictive maintenance • Image classification • Recommendation engines Hence choosing which approach is best for your needs, be it supervised or unsupervised machine learning algorithm, usually depends on factors related to the structure and volume of your data, and the use case to which you want to apply it.

          "It is no news these days that Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has created new opportunities to progress on critical issues such as health, education, and the environment. In some cases, AI may do things more efficiently or methodically than humans. Now while a number of definitions of artificial intelligence (AI) have surfaced over the last few decades, John McCarthy offers the following definition in his 2004 paper on Artificial Intelligence that - “A.I. is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs, which is related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself to methods that are biologically observable.” So at its simplest form, artificial intelligence is a field, which combines computer science and robust datasets, to enable problem-solving. AI can fall under “narrow,” “general,” and “super.” These categories demonstrate AI’s capabilities, where “Narrow” is AI trained and focused to perform specific tasks, Narrow AI drives most of the AI that surrounds us today. It enables some very robust applications, such as Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, and autonomous vehicles. “General” is a theoretical form of AI where a machine would have an intelligence equaled to humans; it would have a self-aware consciousness that has the ability to solve problems, learn, and plan for the future, and “Super” would surpass the intelligence and ability of the human brain.",

        paragraph:
          " While strong AI (which consist of General and Super) is still entirely theoretical with no practical examples in use today, that doesn't mean AI researchers aren't also exploring its development. Arend Hintze, a researcher and professor of integrative biology at Michigan State University, states that there are four (4) main types of AI, which are:",
        bullets: [
          "Reactive machines Reactive machines are AI systems that have no memory and are task specific, meaning that an input always delivers the same output. Machine learning models tend to be reactive machines because they take customer data, such as purchase or search history, and use it to deliver recommendations to the same customers, this can be seen on most streaming platforms, where they use what the customer views to recommend more content. Compare this to our human lives, where most of our actions are not reactive because we don’t have all the information we need to react upon, but we have the capability to remember and learn. Based on those successes or failures, we may act differently in the future if faced with a similar situation.",
          "Limited memory The next type of AI in its evolution is limited memory. This algorithm imitates the way our brains’ neurons work together, meaning that it gets smarter as it receives more data to train on. Deep learning improves image recognition and other types of reinforcement learning. Limited memory AI, unlike reactive machines, can look into the past and monitor specific objects or situations over time. Then, these observations are programmed into the AI so that its actions can perform based on both past and present moment data. But in limited memory, this data isn’t saved into the AI’s memory as experience to learn from, the way humans might derive meaning from their successes and failures. The AI improves over time as it’s trained on more data. A good example of limited memory AI is the way self-driving cars observe other cars on the road for their speed, direction, and proximity. This information is programmed as the car’s representation of the world, such as knowing traffic lights, signs, curves, and bumps in the road. The data helps the car decide when to change lanes so that it does not get hit or cut off another driver.",
          "Theory of mind The first two types of AI, reactive machines and limited memory, are types that currently exist. Theory of mind is a type of AI that will be built in the future. As such, there isn’t any real world example yet, but when it is developed, theory of mind AI could have the potential to understand the world and how other entities have thoughts and emotions. In turn, this affects how they behave in relation to those around them.",
          "Self-awareness The grand finale for the evolution of AI would be to design systems that have a sense of self, a conscious understanding of their existence, and just like Theory of Mind AI, this type of AI does not exist yet. This goes a step beyond theory of mind AI and understanding emotions, to being aware of themselves, their state of being, and being able to sense or predict others’ feelings. For example, “I’m hungry” becomes “I know I am hungry” or “I want to eat lasagna because it’s my favorite food.” But we are a long way from self-aware AI because there is still so much to uncover about the human brain’s intelligence and how memory, learning, and decision-making work. So while it’s a fact that AI has various use in different industries and brings tangible results, especially in this day and age where there is a new form of AI online, it’s also difficult to immediately decide how to use it.",

          "The digital and IT department of any organization is an essential part of the organization as it decides just how much it can survive in this Digital Age, where the world revolves around TECH. With this in mind, most organizations end up being digitized, and not digitally transformed. So what’s the difference between digitization and digital transformation? Digitization, simply put, is the move from analogue to digital. That is handwritten ledgers, typed documents, and ink-on-paper records being converted into digital computer files. On the other hand, Digital transformation is not just a move but, changing the process and looking for ways to enable better decision making, faster response time, knowing how to adapt your business to growing trends and technological changes, and a better and personalized customer experience. Simply put, Digital transformation is the process of using digital technologies to create new, or modify existing, business processes, culture, and customer experiences to meet changing business and market requirements. But digital transformation can be hard to achieve without the right experts and consultation, as most people tend to mistake digitization and digital transformation for each other in the bid to catch up in the digital age. This is why Hampshire heights, as a leading consulting firm that specializes in IT services, management, and operational readiness, business transformation, and artificial intelligence, to name a few of our services, has made it, its mission to not only provide appropriate solution and improve the standard of our clients businesses across board, and the society as a whole, but also ensure that our clients’ digital transformation materializes and leads to a positive impact on their businesses.",

          "Data privacy generally means the ability of a person to determine for themselves when, how, and to what extent personal information about them is shared with or communicated to others. This personal information can be one's name, location, contact information, or online or real-world behavior. In fact, today you may need to comply with a host of data privacy regulations that exist around the world and across industry sectors. For example, The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which went into effect on May 25, 2018, is a comprehensive data privacy law that establishes a framework for the collection, processing, storage, and transfer of personal data. It requires that all personal data be processed in a secure fashion, and it includes fines and penalties for businesses that do not comply with these requirements. Though GDPR applied to organizations in the EU and the European Economic Area, It also extended the reach of those regulations to apply to non-EU organizations if they process personal data collected in the EU, Just like the EU, the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) has long required covered entities to appoint someone who essentially must act as a privacy and security officer. This makes data privacy a critical aspect of managing and analyzing data, and data privacy consultants play an essential role in ensuring that organizations are compliant with applicable laws and regulations. Data privacy consultants must have a strong technical background, analytical skills, and excellent communication skills. They must be able to conduct data privacy audits, develop and implement data privacy policies and procedures, monitor compliance, and conduct data privacy training for employees. Hampshire Heights offers Data Protection officer (DPO) consultancy services to organizations across the globe. Our expert consultants will support you to demystify your obligations by aligning technology and operations decision-making with data privacy standards and best practices. Our data security experts have many years of experience and expertise in data privacy as well as data protection impact assessment.",

          "Every product moves through a life cycle right from the project initiation stage through developing a product until it reaches the end of the life cycle. Although the product is designed to function efficiently, minor changes in the surrounding environment can affect its efficiency. Therefore, the problem requires conscious thinking to analyze and solve potential risk before launch, this is where operational readiness comes into play. Operational readiness involves efficient functioning of the project and maintenance through specifically designed procedures, while keeping potential problematic aspects in mind. That is a structured process of ensuring the operations team acquire the tools, skills and documentation to operate and maintain a newly completed project. It is important to finalize the operation readiness process during the initial planning phase of a project or product development, to ensure proper budget and resource allocation. Additionally, members should not perform the task at the end of the project; rather, it should be part of each phase of the building process. This holds benefits in the long run, as it grants easy access to the problem at each step, and allows the team to get used to solving the problem. As experienced project managers, that take great pride in delivering projects for our clients to time, budget and to quality. Hampshire Heights, is an expert in managing the risks, issues and changes on the project and monitoring progress against plan and budget whilst maintaining communications with stakeholders.
